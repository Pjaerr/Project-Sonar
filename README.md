# Project-Sonar
A Global Game Jam 2017 game based on the theme "Waves". 

You play as a bat flying through an endlessly generated cave. Your goal is to survive for as long as possible. 
The only catch is that you can only see the cave walls when using your sonar wave. How long can you survive?

Game was created for the global game jam 2017 with myself, Michael Newton, Ryan Hood and Harry Biggs.
The state of the game when the jam ended can be found in the 3rd commit.
